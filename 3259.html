<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font size="3"><b>OBITUARY:</b><br><b>Patricia Ann (Woods) Firestone</b> was born October 12, 1938 in Greenwood, Arkansas and passed peacefully in her home June 11, 2015 in Sherman Oaks, California.  Her parents were Doyle William and Lenora Evelyn Woods and she moved to California when she was 7 years old.  Pat met Ron Firestone in high school (North Hollywood High School, California) when she was 15, and married her high school sweetheart Ron when she was 17 in 1956.  They were married for 58 years.<br><br>She had three sons, Christopher, Tom, and Andrew.  Pat dedicated her life to caring for her husband and children.  Being a homemaker was a job that Pat took very seriously and at it she excelled.  But Patricia wore many hats.  As it is often said, "Behind every great man, there is a great woman."  In addition to making her family's house a home and raising three active sons, Patricia worked to keep her husband's architectural firm running smoothly.  She acted as bookkeeper, human resources, and office manager for decades.  She enjoyed many hobbies over the years including tennis, needlepoint, knitting, sewing, crafting, and antique and doll collecting.<br><br>Pat was one of four children and is survived by her brother, Doyle Woods and his wife Coralee, brother Chuck, sister Kathy Mares, sons Tom and Andrew; daughters-in-law, Johnece, Panit, and Karen; eight grandchildren, Bridget Isenberger and husband Mark, Meredith, Nicholas, Wesley, Spencer, Alexander, Aidan, and Samantha.  She was preceded in death by her oldest son, Christopher and her husband, Ronald.  Patricia's greatest love in life was her family.  Keeping her family close was her purpose.  She lived to spend time with her children and grandchildren, to experience their milestones and special events.  She made every gathering of family special, whether it was a holiday, birthday, or one of countless family dinners.  Patricia was a true matriarch.  She will be deeply missed by her family.<br><br><b>FUNERAL:<br></b>June 22, 2015 at Sherman Oaks Lutheran Church; Pastor Daniel Pezzica, officiant</font></p>
