<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font size="3"><b>OBITUARY:</b><br><b>Ronald Gordon Firestone</b> was born August 23, 1936 in Grand Junction, Colorado and died January 30, 2015 in Sherman Oaks, CA. His parents were Gordon and Mary Firestone and he moved to California when he was seven years old. Ron married his high school sweetheart, Patricia Woods, in 1956 and was married for 58 years. He had three sons, Christopher, Thomas, and Andrew. <br><br>Ron was a natural artist from the beginning, drawing animals and painting fine art landscapes at an early age. In his early twenties he worked as an animator and cartoonist with Walt Disney for a short period of time. Ron soon ventured out on his own, starting his company Firestone Design, as a residential architect in 1957. He pioneered the popular period style of estates: English Manor, English &amp; French Country, and Mediterranean, and designed numerous homes in Beverly Hills, Bel Air, throughout California, and throughout the world. Ron also designed a number of fast food restaurants including El Torito, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell, and the original Wienerschnitzel. His clientele included celebrities and dignitaries from around the world. Though he enjoyed these interesting projects and people, Ron was only driven by the need to be creative, to use the natural talents given to him by God. People loved him for being a humble, kind, and generous person, always ready to share a smile and a laugh. Because of this, many of his clients and associates became life-long friends.<br><br>Ron was one of four children and is survived by his spouse, Patricia; sisters Loretta and Maureen and brother-in-law Monroe; brother Mark; sons Tom and Andrew; daughters-in-law Johnece, Panit, and Karen; eight grandchildren, Bridget and husband Mark, Meredith, Nicholas, Wesley, Spencer, Alexander, Aidan, and Samantha. He was preceded in death by his oldest son, Christopher. <br><br>Ron lived each day to its fullest with energy and passion. His work ethic was unmatched and he was blessed to do something he truly loved. He went to work with a positive attitude and gave it his all, as he did with all of life and his friends and family. He was always present for his grandchildren's milestones and events, spent every holiday with his children and grandchildren, many vacations, and countless family dinners. He touched everyone who knew him and he will be greatly missed.</font></p>
