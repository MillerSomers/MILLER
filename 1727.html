Cope):</b><br>   "I first opened my eyes on the beautiful round world in the hill country of Ohio, Muskingum Co. about 25 miles S.W. of Zanesville.  I was born Sept 2, 1814, nine o'clock in the morning.<br>   Father was a German born in America.  My mother was of Scottish descent but born in America.  My father came from Millersburg Ky and my mother from New Jersey and settled in the wild world of Ohio.  Before I was a year old my father sold<br>   Before I was a year old my father sold his home in Muskingum Co. and moved to Fairfield Co.  He was a hard working man but a poor financer.  He was of a roaming disposition.  After living in Fairfield Co. a while he moved to Pickaway Co.  Later went to Franklin Oh. 13 Mi. N.W. of Columbus.  In each of these places were kept busy clearing bush.  This was our schooling.<br>   After selling out at a great sacrifice in Franklin Co., he moved his family and effects to Cass, Mich.  A new country sparingly settled.  Many Indians camped around about.  This was a good move, he bought 400 acres rich land on the south side of Beardsley prairie.  His farm crossed the line into St. Joseph Co. land.  <br>   When I was 23 years of age I went back to the land of my birth and to visit some relatives there whom I had never seen.  Two of my mother's and one of my father's brothers and one of my mother's sisters.  While making the visit I met Elizabeth Colvin the daughter of John Calvin and Amelia Wiley.  During my visit which lasted several months I became acquainted with most of my relatives.  Mother's only sister<br>   Mrs. Williams and family were members of the Baptist Church.  Anthony Miller, my father's brother was in his grave but his widow and six children were still in the neighborhood.  <br>   I married Elizabeth Colvin whom I have learned to love and for whose family had formed a warm friendship and respect.  Seated on a woman's saddle on horseback she bid farewell to home and friends and traveled with me 400 mi. to live in a strange land.  No better proof of her love was necessary than this great sacrifice.  She got homesick and in about a year we returned to her father's home.  I got work here in the carpenter line.  Here I became converted and commenced my work as an Evangelist.  <br>   A year later we returned to Mich.  I bought 80 a. of land half a mile from my father's home over the Indiana line."</font></p>
