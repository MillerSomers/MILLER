<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font size="3"><b>NOTES:</b><br><b>Sehoy III </b>was an Indian princess of the prestigious Wind Clan (Hutalgalgi), the highest ranking tribe of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation.  She was also known as "Princess of the Wind".<br><br>Sehoy III was the granddaughter of <b>Captain Jean Baptiste Louis DeCourtel Marchand</b>, French commander of Fort Toulouse in Alabama; and <b>Sehoy I</b>, Indian princess of the prestigious Wind Clan (Hutalgalgi), the highest ranking tribe of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation.<br><br>Her step-father was <b>Lachlan McGillivray</b> (of the Clan MacGillivray Chiefs Lineage, part of the Clan Chattan Confederation of the Scottish Highland) who migrated to the Colonies and became a wealthy fur trader and planter in Georgia.<br><br>Her half-brother was <b>Alexander McGillivray</b> who became Chief of the Upper Creek (Muscogee) Indians, one of the most powerful and historically important Native American chiefs among the Creek of the Southeast.<br><br>Her grandson was <b>Major David Moniac, </b>an American military officer who in 1822 became the first Native American graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point.<br><br><b>EVENTS:</b><br>Sehoy III first married <b>Colonel David Tate </b>who was the Commander of Fort Toulouse. There were several children from this marriage, including a son, also named David Tate (half brother to Red Eagle). When the British left Fort Toulouse, Colonel Tate deserted his wife and children. Divorce came automatically with abandonment or moving from the Creek Nation. <br><br>At this time, Sehoy III married <b>Charles Weatherford</b>, a wealthy Scots trader known for his red hair.  Their son became famed <b>Chief "Red Eagle"</b> of the Wind Clan (Hutalgalgi), the highest ranking tribe of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation.<br><br>Sehoy III was of the Wind Clan, which was referred to as "The House Of Wind, The Ruling Tribe". Sehoy was brought up in her early days by Sam Moniac. She was very beautiful as was her mother and grandmother. James Albert Pickett's book "The History of Alabama" tells us a story of an incident that had taken place in 1792, The Creeks were frequently attacking homes on the Cumberland. They had captured a young girl by the name of Elizabeth Baker and brought her back to Coosawda after murdering her family before her eyes. Across the river, Charles had heard of the incident and he ransomed the young girl back and placed her with Sehoy III. Sehoy is buried with her sons William (Red Eagle) and John (Jack) and a daughter and an adopted child. They are buried on David Tate's "Brickyard Plantation". In letters to Col. A.J. Pickett which are dated 1858 states that Malcom McPherson was the natural father of Sehoy who had married John Tate and Charles Weatherford. Some seem to think Lachlan McGillivray. Sehoy was introduced to Charles through McGillivray. He had arranged for the marriage of Sehoy and Charles. At the birth of their son William "Red Eagle," there was attendance by a huge delegation of Great War Chiefs and prophets of the Creek Nation for the importance of Sehoy ranking as a princess in the ruling of the Wind Clan of the Creeks. As I have referred to before... At times you will find information stating that the Tribes had no such title as a "princess", but others tend to state there was. Her young Chief would spend his first ten years in the atmosphere around Alexander McGillivray. The respect that the young Chief carried for his fine uncle and just the association alone, proved rewarding for the future Chief that would later fight for his people. The Americans that had removed from the white settlement and into the Alabama area were surprised to find the Creeks not only well adjusted, but intelligent as well. They were surprised to find the Creeks were quite wealthy and living in permanent housing, along with slaves. They were also a tribe that was rich in farmlands and domesticated animals. At the age of sixteen Sehoy's son had completed his three years of torturous preparation and her son became a Warrior of the Creek Nation. By the time her son was at the age of twenty, he had become a Minor War Chief. He was a very handsome man with undeniable qualities for leadership of his people. He was also a wealthy young man who could indulge in dramatic costume and fine horses. He would dress in the most elaborate bleached white buckskins and rode the finest of the stallions from the Little River stables. He made a very striking appearance with his eyes of black and his handsomely bronzed face. Sehoy was very proud of her son.<br><i>(see http://www.geni.com/people/Sahoy-III-of-Tuckabatche/6000000019791362177)</i></font></p>
