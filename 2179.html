<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font size="3">By Kathie Kline - Oct 23, 1999<br><b>JOHN BORDER (JOHANNES BADER) 1776-1856<br></b>John Border or Johannes Bader, as he was christened, was born 29 Jun 1776 in Frederick County, Maryland. He was christened 29 Sep 1776 at the Evangelical Lutheran Church of St. Peters, Frederick County, Maryland. The sponsors were Johannes and Elisabeth Schwedner.<br>He was the son of Sebold and Regina Bader. John died 11 Jul 1856 in Bedford County, Pennsylvania. He was buried at the Old German Reformed Church. This church was located in Bedford City. The United Church of Christ is now standing at this location. The grave stones have been removed and are all placed together side by side. John's grave stone is partly broken and is getting hard to read. It states that he was 80 years 2 months and 16 days old when he died. The actual grave sites have been turned into a grassy area with gazebo in the middle.<br>John was married 3 times and had 19 children. He died at the age of 80 years 7 months and 16 days. This would make his birth date as 25 Nov 1775 so there are different dates regarding his birth. There are conflicting statements about were John originated. One source says that he was a native of Germany and an early settler of Bedford County, Pennsylvania. Another source says he came from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. After finding the christening records in Frederick County, Maryland, it shows that John was born in Frederick County, Maryland. His father or grandfather was probably from Germany. <br>Among his occupations were gunsmith, wheelwright, wagon maker, rake maker, and farmer. His farm was about 4 miles from Schellsburg, Bedford, PA.<br>On 11 Jun 1794, Daniel Baker was appointed as his guardian until he should arrive at age.<br>John was an apprentice at gunsmithing with Philip Creamer of Tanneytown, Maryland in 1799.<br>In the 1800 census he is listed as John Bowder with 2 males under 10, 1 male 26-45 and one female 16-26 in Tanneytown, Frederick County, Maryland.<br>By 1804 John was in Bedford County, Pennsylvania. He was listed on a subscriber list for the Old Log Church in Schellsburg in 1806.<br>Among the tax lists of Bedford County, John is listed as follows. Taxes for the year 1808 in St. Clair Township, shows John with 100 acres of land, 1 horse, 1 cow, occupation of wheelwright, with a value of $180.00 and a tax of $1.25. In 1814 in Napier Township, John is listed as a wagon maker. He has 135 acres of patent land, 2 horses, 2 cattle, valuation of $244.00 and a tax of $1.23. In the 1817 tax list of Napier Township, John has a saw mill, 3 horses, 3 cattle, value of $328.00 and a tax of $1.52. In 1820 John still has the saw mill, 4 horses, 2 cattle, a value of $953.00 and a tax of $4.76. In 1823 he has a gist mill, 2 horses, 2 cattle, $455.00 valuation and a tax of $2.27. The 1826 tax record show that John has 300 acres of improved land, 2 horses, 2 cattle with a value of $125.00. No tax amount is given. In 1829, the same assets are listed but with a valuation of $117.00. In 1832, John has 1 less cattle with a valuation of $240.00. In 1835 he still has 300 acres of improved land, 1 horse, 9 cattle with a value of $76.50. His occupation is listed as farmer. The tax record for 1838 doesn't list the amount of land that John still has but shows that he had 2 cattle and 2 horses with a value of $134.25. In 1841 his occupation is still farmer with 2 cattle and a value of $40.00. In 1844 his occupation is a rake maker with 3 cattle and a value of $26.00 Most of his land is sold before 1847 as the tax record show him with only 1 acre of land with a value of $45.00 and 1 cattle with a value of $81.00. In 1850 the value of his 1 acre of land is only $31.00 and his 1 cattle is $11.00. In 1853 the land has a value of $50.00 and the cattle $58.00.  <br>The Old Log Church in Schellsburg was both a Lutheran and a German Reformed Church. The church is still standing and is used for various events. In the church records of the Old Log Church, John is listed as a subscriber in 1806 as a Lutheran. In 1814 he gave $1.00 to the church for the completion of the gallery. There are records for the christening of some of his children at this church.<br>In 1810 John is listed in the census record for St. Clair Township, Bedford, Pennsylvania with 4 males under 10 years of age, 1 male age 10 thru 16, and 1 male 26 thru 45, 1 female under 10 years of age and 1 female age 26 thru 45. <br>In 1820 Napier Township there are 5 males under 10, 2 males 10 thru 16, 1 male 16 thru 18, 2 males 16 thru 26, 1 male 26 thru 45, 2 females under 10, 1 female age 16 thru 26, and 1 female age 26 thru 45. <br>The 1830 census for Napier Township shows John's family as 2 males under 5, 1 male 5 thru 10, 1 male 10 thru 15, 1 male 50 thru 60, 1 female under 5, 1 female 15 thru 20. <br>In 1840, John is still in Napier Township.

John didn't seem to age any between the 1830 and the 1840 census. <br>The 1850 census is the first one to list the names of all the family members. John is shown as 75 years old with a value of $200.00. He is born in Maryland. His wife is Sarah, age 50 born in Pennsylvania. Caroline is 17 years old, Susannah 13 years old, Cyrus E age 9, and Catharine J age 7.<br>On 15 Sep 1808 John bought 153 acres from William and Amy Blackburn for 300 pounds.
