<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font size="3"><b>BIOGRAPHY:<br></b>In 1809, or 1810, <b>JOSEPH SHRUM</b> bought, and settled upon, 88 acres in Mifflin Township, where W. S. Shrum, his son later lived. He was a <u>native of Germany</u>, and in 1800, when 18 or 19 years of age, he emigrated to this country. For a year or two, he lived in Little York, Pennsylvania, and then came to Franklin County, and located in Hamilton Township, where he had a distillery, for a couple of years, on the Shoaf farm, on the Chillicothe Road. Afterwards, he bought 160 acres in the same township, which was later the Klickinger farm, which he lost on account of imperfect title, when he came into Mifflin township and settled. Soon after his settlement, he built a distillery on the west bank of the Olentangy, just south of his residence. The still was burned down in 1824 or 1825, but he rebuilt it the same year, but on the east side of the river, and carried on distilling until 1837, when he retired from active business. <br>January 1, 1809, he was married to Elizabeth McGranahan, by whom he had seven children. She died in 1823, and he was married twice afterwards, but had no children by these subsequent marriages. Mr. Shrum, was killed, in September, 1859, by a train of cars on the Piqua Road, while driving over the long crossing, west of Jones Mill, living 48 hours after the accident. At the time of his death, he was over 88 years of age. Although owning and operating a distillery, he was a strictly temperate man in his habits. For 30 years he was a member of the Franklinton Dragoons. <br>A son and two daughters were living in 1880: W. S. Shrum, born in Mifflin Township in 1814 and then residing on the homestead; Mrs. Elizabeth Reams, in Michigan, and Mrs. Lucy Gillen, in the State of Illinois.</font></p>
