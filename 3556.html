A Creek with some Scots ancestry, who was related to major Creek leaders on both sides of his family, Moniac was the first cadet to West Point from the new state of Alabama. Moniac resigned his commission in 1822 to manage his clan's property in Alabama, where he developed a cotton plantation.<br><br>In 1816, he was appointed to the US Military Academy at West Point, New York, under a provision of a US treaty in 1791 which called for the education of a limited number of Creek children at government expense. He moved to Washington, DC for training by an Irish tutor, and entered West Point on September 18, 1817. He graduated on July 1, 1822, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 6th Infantry Regiment. He resigned this commission six months later and returned to Alabama to assist his family. He married Mary Powell, a cousin of Osceola, the leader of the Florida Seminoles. <br><br>In 1836, the US Government raised a regiment of Creeks from Alabama to fight the Seminoles in Florida during the Second Seminole War. He was commissioned as a Captain on August 17, 1836 \endash  the only Native American to be commissioned. The Creek regiment joined the main Army of Keith Call, governor of Florida, on October 19th, and he was promoted to Major. In an engagement on the Withlacoochee River in the Wahoo Swamp (see Battle of Wahoo Swamp), he initiated an assault against the Seminoles, but was struck fatally by a musket ball.<br><br>In the 1990s, his remains were transferred from a local cemetery to the newly established Florida National Cemetery for military veterans, a few miles away.</font></p>
