<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font size="3"><b>REV. OLIVER PRIOR MILLER &amp; JANE (WADE) MILLER -- </b>Rev. O.P. Miller is active in both church and temperance work and his influence has ever been for the uplifting and benefit of his fellowment. There is in him an abiding sympathy and charity which have won for him the deserved confidence and good will of his fellow townsmen, and his efforts have been a moving force in the moral development of the community in which he has long made his home.<br>   He was born in Jefferson township, Cass county, on the 20th of February, 1847, his parents being the Rev. John P. and Mary (Shrum) Miller, prominent and honored residents of this part of the state. In their family were the following named: Mrs. Sarah Garvy; Adam, deceased; Martha, the widow of Jeremiah Keneston and a resident of Jefferson township, Cass county; Mrs. Lydia Weaver, who died in 1898; Rev. B.R. Miller, who is living in Goshen, Indiana; Susan, who died at the age of thirteen years; O.P., of this review; and Leander, deceased.<br>   As the above record indicates, Rev. O.P. Miller is next to the youngest of the family. His boyhood days were quietly passed in the usual manner of farm hands. He was reared in Jefferson township and his education was acquired in the common schools. When not busy with his text-books he often aided in the work of the fields, and he remained with his father up to the time of his marriage, which event was celebrated on the 20th of November, 1864, <b>Miss Jane Wade</b> becoming his wife. She was born in Canada but was reared in Illinois and Michigan, her parents being William B. and Anna (Gilmore) Wade, who removed from Canada to Illinois and afterward came to this state.<br>   Mr. and Mrs. Miller began their domestic life upon a farm in Jeffereson township, where they resided until 1881, in which year they took up their abode in LaGrange township, two miles west of Cassopolis. There Mr. Miller carried on farming until 1891, in which year he was ordained in the ministry of the Christian church, and he has since devoted his life to preaching the gospel. He is now located in Cassopolis.<br>   He comes of a family of ministers, there having been many clergymen among the Miller family. In the father's family there were four brothers who became preachers of the word, most of them being connected with the Church of the Disciples or Christian church.<br>   Unto Mr. and Mrs. Miller have been born three children: Edwin, who is living in Cassopolis; Anna O., now the wife of Lewis Cays, of the same city; and Alva, who is at home. They also reared two adopted children, Charles Wade and Addie Miller, both of whom became members of the household in infancy.<br>   At one time Mr. Miller was a staunch advocate of Democratic principles, but in later years has been associated with the Prohibition party, which embodies his views on the temperance question. ... All who know him respect him for his fidelity and for his courageous expression of the views which he entertains, and he has won the love and confidence of many by his sympathy and his earnest work in behalf of those who have needed not only spiritual but material aid as well.<br><br><i>See: Cass County, Michigan Genealogy MIGenWeb, part of the USGenWeb Project (www.migenweb.org/cass/biographies/cassixm.htm#OMILLER); typed by Larry Sullivan</i><br><br><b>DEATH: </b>According to his obituary dated July 11, 1918 and the Michigan Death Records 1897-1920, he died on July 9, 1918, NOT July 19, 1918 as is stated on numerous family trees.  He died at the age of 71.<br><b>RELIGION:</b> Minister of the Christian Church<br><br><b>OBITUARY: </b><i>"The Cassopolis Vigilant"</i>, Thursday, July 11, 1918 page 1 --<br>   Rev. Oliver P. Miller died at his home (at age 71) in this village Tuesday afternoon death resulting from a series of apoplectic strokes. Funeral services will be held this afternoon at three o'clock at the Baptist church in this village, interment in Propsect Hill Cemetery.<br>   In the death of Mr. Miller, Casopolis loses one of its best citizens, one whose influence for good was felt far beyond the confines of home contrary and show everyday contact with men was in accordance with the gospel which he preached. <br>   Mr. Miller was born in Jefferson township in this county Feb. 20. 1847, and was a son of Rev. John P. and Mary Shrum Miller, pioneer residents of that community. There the deceased grew to manhood and was married Nov 20, 1864 to Miss Jane Wade, also of Jefferson. Theirs has been a happy wedded life for over fifty-three years, they having celebrated their golden wedding anniversary Nov 20, 1914. Their union was blessed with three children, Edwin H., Alva and Olia, wife of Lewis Cays, all residing in this village. In addition to their children they were foster parents to Chas. Wade of Dowagiac and Miss Adalyne Miller. <br>   Mr. and Mrs. Miller engaged in farming in Jefferson, remaining there until 1881, when they removed to a farm west of this village and they have been identified with this community practically ever since. Coming from a family which had produced many preachers Mr. Miller early cherished a desire to preach the gospel, and though possessed of only a common school education he supplemented this with a large amount of home study and became an effective exponent of the scriptures, being ordained to the ministry of the Christian church in 1891. He successibely held succcessful pastorateds, his most successful labors probably being at New Carlisle, Ind., where he served for several years and where he built up and strenghtened a large church. It was his desire last year that he again become their paster, but owing to failing health he was forced to decline. Agriculture and the ministry divided his efforts during most of this active years, and he enjoyed both. His fidelity to the cause which he preached, his kindly interest in his fellows, his integrity, and his unassuming ways won for him a host of friends and the respect and esteem of all who knew him. Always prompt to respond to the call to service, he has been called to innumberable homes where death has come and has officiated at more funeral services than any other Cass county pastor, and only after he had been stricken with apoplexy did he cease to respond to the numerous calls made upon him. <br>   Mr. Miller was in splendid health until a few months ago. Feeling deeply the war situation and believing this his county must do its part he was preparing to go to the depot one morning last fall to bid God-speed to one of the first contingents of Cass county boys to leave for the training camps, when he was first stricken. After a time he rallied and partially recovered, but successive strokes resulted in his death. In many homes his passing will be felt as a distint personal loss, and all will be sorry to learn of the passing of earnest, sincere, kindly Oliver Miller.
