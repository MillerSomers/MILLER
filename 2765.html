<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font size="3">From the out of copyright <i>"A Twentieth Century History of Berrien County, Michigan"</i> 1906, by Orville William Coolidge...<br><br>"<b>MARSHALL D. FRANKLIN</b> is the owner of a good farm of eighty acres on section 20 in Chikaming township, and throughout his entire life has followed farming. In addition to the raising of cereals best adapted to soil and climate he is now engaged quite extensively and successfully in agricultural pursuits and has an excellent fruit farm. He was born in Belfast, Allegany county, New York, November 15, 1850, a son of Freeman W. and Lucinda (Daniels) Franklin, natives of New York and descendants of New England parentage. The father died at the home of his son, Marshall D., in Berrien county, December 31, 1903, in the eightieth year of his age, and his wife passed away at Decatur, Michigan, when sixty years of age. In the family were four children, as follows: Marshall D.; Mrs. Mary D. Monroe, of Chicago, the widow of W. S. Monroe, at one time a resident of Berrien county; John B., a farmer of Decatur, Michigan ; and Charles, who died at the age of four years. <br><br>Marshall D. Franklin came to Michigan with his parents when thirteen years of age, the family home being established in Decatur. There amid pioneer surroundings he was reared, and the public schools afforded him his educational privileges. He received ample training at farm labor and the practical experience and knowledge which he gained in his youth proved of the utmost value to him in his later business career. He was married in 1877, and in 1881 came to his present farm, comprising eighty acres of land on section 20, Chikaming township. He had always followed farming and he took his land when it was covered with the second growth of timber. This he cleared away and has placed the fields under a high state of cultivation, while upon the farm he has erected good modern buildings, furnishing ample shelter for grain and stock. He now devotes his time and energies to tilling the soil and to cultivating fruit, and his horticultural interests have proven an important feature of his business. He has had as many as five acres planted to strawberries and there are eight hundred peach trees upon his place. <br><br>September 5, 1877, occurred the marriage of Mr. Franklin and Miss Viola Glidden, who was born in Porter township, Van Buren county, March 5, 1856, a daughter of Stephen M. and Mary (Peabody) Glidden. Her father now resides at Lakeside but her mother is deceased. Unto Mr. and Mrs. Franklin have been born two daughters: Nora A., now the wife of Oscar Duddleson, of Three Oaks; and Clara B., at home.<br><br>Although reared in the faith of the Republican party, to which he gave his support until 1896, Mr. Franklin is now a stalwart Democrat. He has held every office in his township except that of school inspector, having been elected to minor positions on the Republican ticket. Later he was chosen to more important positions on the peoples ticket. He served as supervisor for one term, has been treasurer two terms, clerk for one term and is now serving for the second term as justice of the peace. He was likewise highway commissioner for one term. He has never missed voting at an election since he was twenty-one years of age and in the discharge of his official duties is always found to be prompt and faithful, his labors characterized by unfaltering loyalty to the public good. He is a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church at Lakeside and has filled all of the offices therein, and he is a charter member of Three Oaks Lodge, Knights of the Maccabees. The greater part of his life has been spent in Michigan, and for a quarter of a century he has lived upon his present farm which in its splendidly improved condition indicates the care and labor which he bestows upon it, making it an excellent property."<br></font></p>
