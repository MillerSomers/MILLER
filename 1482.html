<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font size="3"><b>IMMIGRATION: </b>Canada to the United States in 1857<br><br><b>REV. OLIVER PRIOR MILLER &amp; JANE (WADE) MILLER -- </b>Rev. O.P. Miller is active in both church and temperance work and his influence has ever been for the uplifting and benefit of his fellowment. There is in him an abiding sympathy and charity which have won for him the deserved confidence and good will of his fellow townsmen, and his efforts have been a moving force in the moral development of the community in which he has long made his home.<br>   He was born in Jefferson township, Cass county, on the 20th of February, 1847, his parents being the Rev. John P. and Mary (Shrum) Miller, prominent and honored residents of this part of the state. In their family were the following named: Mrs. Sarah Garvy; Adam, deceased; Martha, the widow of Jeremiah Keneston and a resident of Jefferson township, Cass county; Mrs. Lydia Weaver, who died in 1898; Rev. B.R. Miller, who is living in Goshen, Indiana; Susan, who died at the age of thirteen years; O.P., of this review; and Leander, deceased.<br>   As the above record indicates, Rev. O.P. Miller is next to the youngest of the family. His boyhood days were quietly passed in the usual manner of farm hands. He was reared in Jefferson township and his education was acquired in the common schools. When not busy with his text-books he often aided in the work of the fields, and he remained with his father up to the time of his marriage, which event was celebrated on the 20th of November, 1864, <b>Miss Jane Wade</b> becoming his wife. She was born in Canada but was reared in Illinois and Michigan, her parents being William B. and Anna (Gilmore) Wade, who removed from Canada to Illinois and afterward came to this state.<br>   Mr. and Mrs. Miller began their domestic life upon a farm in Jeffereson township, where they resided until 1881, in which year they took up their abode in LaGrange township, two miles west of Cassopolis. There Mr. Miller carried on farming until 1891, in which year he was ordained in the ministry of the Christian church, and he has since devoted his life to preaching the gospel. He is now located in Cassopolis.<br>   He comes of a family of ministers, there having been many clergymen among the Miller family. In the father's family there were four brothers who became preachers of the word, most of them being connected with the Church of the Disciples or Christian church.<br>   Unto Mr. and Mrs. Miller have been born three children: Edwin, who is living in Cassopolis; Anna O., now the wife of Lewis Cays, of the same city; and Alva, who is at home. They also reared two adopted children, Charles Wade and Addie Miller, both of whom became members of the household in infancy.<br>   At one time Mr. Miller was a staunch advocate of Democratic principles, but in later years has been associated with the Prohibition party, which embodies his views on the temperance question. ... All who know him respect him for his fidelity and for his courageous expression of the views which he entertains, and he has won the love and confidence of many by his sympathy and his earnest work in behalf of those who have needed not only spiritual but material aid as well.<br><br><i>See: Cass County, Michigan Genealogy MIGenWeb, part of the USGenWeb Project (www.migenweb.org/cass/biographies/cassixm.htm#OMILLER); typed by Larry Sullivan</i><br><br><b>OBITUARY:</b> "The Cassopolis Vigilant", Thursday, February 3, 1938 --<br>   Mrs. Jane MIller (Aunty Jane Miller to a host of younger friends) died at her home in this village about eleven o'clock a.m. yesterday, aged 93 years, 5 months and 8 days. Mrs. Miller had enjoyed splendid health for one of her years until quite recently, and was up town shopping as late as last Thursday. Funeral services will be held in the Presbyterian church at 2:30 p.m. Friday, conducted by Rev. D. L. Reedy and Frank Davis and burial will be in Propect Hill Cemetery.<br>   Mrs. Miller was one of six sons and six daughters of the Late William Brookfield and Anna (Gilman) Wade, eleven of which chidren grew to maturity and had families. She was born at Williams, Ontario, Aug 25, 1844. The family came to Michigan in 1857 and first located south of Adamsville in this county, later moving to Jefferson township and finally to Brownsville. She was married Nov 20. 1864 to Oliver P. Miller, son of a pioneer Jefferson minister and himself to become a minister of the Christian Church. The first years of their married life were spent upon a farm in Jefferson townsip but in 1880 they moved to a place west of Cassopolis and later to this village which had since been their home. They had became the parents of three children, Ed. H. deceased, Olia, wife of Lewis Cays, and Alva, all of Cassopolis. In addition to her own children, Mrs. Miller became a mother of two others, having taken a nephew, Chas. in his infancy, and having been a mother to one grandaughter, Miss Adelyne Miller. Sine the death of Mr. Miller, July 19, 1918, she had continued to live at the famly home on East State street, her granddaughter being with her much of the time and her daughter residing beside her.<br>   Mrs. Miller was a familiar figure in our village for as the years mounted she was still able to do her own marketing and came up town nearly every day -- a kindly, smiling old lady whose presence among us was like a benediction. She had a host of friends, for she sowed friendship, and was good to everyone.<br>   She is survived by one daughter and one son, above named, and by six grandchildren and six great grandchildren. Of the original family fo twelve children of who she was one, but on survives, William Wade of Diamond Lake. <i>(http://trees.ancestry.com/owt/person.aspx?pid=133387205)</i></font></p>
