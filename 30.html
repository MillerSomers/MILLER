<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font size="3"><b>NAME:</b> Her middle name "Sarah" is listed on her marriage record with Thomas Sinclair Gore<br><br><b>NOTEWORTHY: </b>Migrated from Ireland to Canada in 1841 with husband Thomas Sinclair Gore, founder of the town of Gore's Landing, Ontario, Canada.  After her husband's death in 1858, Harriette bought an imposing home just up the hill from St. George's, naming it "Glenavy" after the village in County Antrim, Ireland, where she and Thomas Gore grew up and were married. In 1869, she married Frederick W. Barron who remodeled and enlarged the house to re-establish Frederick's "Barron School for Boys" at Glenavy, Gore's Landing on 1 Sep 1870, which he ran until shortly before his death in 1886.<br><br><b>FAMILY: <br></b>-- Her son William Sinclair Gore (1842-1919) moved from Ontario, Canada to British Columbia, Canada in 1875 (at age 35) while a dominion land surveyor working on the westward railroad surveys.  At the age of 38 William was appointed Surveyor-General for the Province of British Columbia, Canada, a position he held twice for 20 years, the record for this post in the British Columbia government.  William was responsible for preliminary land surveys conducted at the north end of Vancouver Island and for several years was the Minister of Lands and Words.  It was he who prepared the specifications for the present legislative buildings in Victoria.  In 1891, William was appointed Deputy Minister/Commissioner of Lands &amp; Works for the Province of British Columbia.  William's many interests included bicycling, golf and canoeing.  He was Commodore of the Victoria Yacht Club and designed and built class winning yachts.  In his later years, he was secretary of the Corporation of British Columbia Land Surveyors.<br><b>-- </b>Her grandson Thomas Sinclair Gore (1869-1955), was an architect who designed, built and owned the renowned Hotel Geneve in the historic "Zona Rosa" district of Mexico City (<i>see: www.hotelgeneve.com.mx/en/)<br></i>-- Her grandson Arthur Sinclair Gore (1879-1976), was a draftsman who started the Electric Blueprint and Map Company in 1907 (at age 28), one of the first engineering supply and blueprint firms, with branches in both Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia.  Arthur Gore's home in Victoria, British Columbia (built in 1912 by famed Canadian artichitect Samuel Maclure) eventually became a designated <i>Heritage Site</i> in 1988.<br><br><b>RELIGION: </b>Member of the Church of England<br><br><b>Used by kind permission, photograph and excerpts from "Gore's Landing and the Rice Lake Plains", by Norma Martin, Catherine Milne, Donna S. McGillis; 1986, printed by Haynes Printing of Cobourg, Ontario, Canada:</b><br><br><i>From page 114:</i><br>     After her second husband died in 1886, the twice-widowed Harriette (Gore) Barron moved to Toronto and, in 1891, sold Glenavy.  Glenavy was destroyed by fire in 1910.  Just visible through the vegetation at the top of Church Hill road in Gore's Landing can still be seen the foundation of the Barron School for boys.<br><br><i>From page 125:</i><br>     When Thomas Gore died at age thirty-eight he had accumulated considerable wealth and left his widow, Harriette, $12,000 plus valuable real estate holdings in the village.  She lived a comfortable life and was able to hire domestic servants, farm workers and a governess for her young children.  Harriette raised six children, some of whom were educated in Europe.  The male Gores pursued successful careers as engineers and architects in Western Canada, Mexico and the United States.<br><br><i>From page 213:</i><br>     Thomas Sinclair Gore House 1844 -- Pictures show the original home of Thomas Gore to be a cottage style with steep gabled roof and end chimneys, probably roughcast over planks.  It featured a facade verandah, a bellcast roof supported by wooden posts and enclosed by a simple railing.  It was set amidst well-tended gardens and afforded a magnificent view of Rice Lake.  The house was destroyed by fire in 1862, four years after the death of Thomas Gore.  His widow, Harriette, and children then moved to the Agnes Heath House.<br><br><i>From page 253:</i><br>     In 1860, when H.R.H. Edward, Prince of Wales, visited Rice Lake, Henry Waldon Sr. [1829-1915, a farmer employed by Thomas &amp; Harriette Gore] rowed his employer, Harriette Gore, then a widow, across Rice Lake to Hiawatha to watch the Royal reception.  When Mrs. Gore's house burned in 1862, Henry Waldon and his wife moved to Castleton.  In 1868, Waldon purchased the 100-acre Gore farm.</font></p>
