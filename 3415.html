<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font size="3">   Son of Lewis &amp; Jane Comer Bench, but he was primarily reared by an Uncle and the Uncle's Wife, John &amp; Mary Bench.<br>   He first married a lady (name unavailable), who died young. She was holding a pin in her mouth which caused her early demise. They had one son.<br>   His second marriage was to Mary Elizabeth Mitchell, and they had seven children prior to her death.<br>   His third marriage was to Mrs. Rebecca Newton Freeman, a widow with five children, and they had had five more children.<br>   There is some question about his middle name. In several census reports, he is shown as Lewis C. Bench, and in some places there are indications that the middle name was Christopher. On the other hand, his birth certificate (which would be a delayed birth certificate) has his name recorded as John Lewis Bench.<br><br><i>(Biographical information about John Lewis Bench was supplied by Mary Lou Freeman Yoder, Wellman, Iowa.)</i></font></p>
