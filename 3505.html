William (Red Ealge) was Muscogee Creek Chief who lead his warriors against the armies of Andrew Jackson, Trying to save their ancestral lands.<br><br>Excerpt from Eliza Howell's family papers.<br><i>"Weatherford, always quick to perceive, knew that Old Hickory was egotistical. Thinking it wise to end his talk with words that were more pleasing to Jackson's ears, he continued. "If I had been left to contend with the Georgian army, I would have raised my corn on one bank of the river and fought them on the other. But your people had destroyed my nation. General Jackson, you are a brave man; I am another. I do not fear to die. But I rely upon your generosity. you will exact no terms of a conquered and helpless people, but those to which they should accede. Whatever that may be, it would be folly and madness to oppose them. If they are opposed, you shall find me among the sternest enforcers of obedience. Those who would still hold out can only be influenced by a mean spirit of revenge. To this, they must not, and shall not, sacrifice the last remnant of their country. You have told us where we may go to be safe. Yours is good talk, and my nation ought to listen. They shall listen."<br></i><br>The surrender was in 1814. Andrew Jackson went on the White House, William Weatherford did go free.
