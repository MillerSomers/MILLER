I also give him another tract lying on the county of Orange, which was conveyed to Anthony Coble and myself jointly, from Israel Holt, and afterwards from the said Coble to me, containing on hundred and seventy-five acres, in addition to which, I have heretofore given him one hundred and twenty five dollars in cash, making in all, three thousand, one hundred dollars.  I now give unto my said son Jacob Summers two thousand dollars more.  <br><br>2nd: To my son Ludwick Summers, and his heirs forever, I give the mill and tract of land on Reedy Fork, and on which he now lives, containing about one hundred and ninety-four acres, the same being made up of three different tracts,(to wit): One which I purchased of John Brown, another of Lewis Morgan and the third of Shadrack Allen. I also give him another tract, which I bought of Benjamin Allen, together with one hundred dollars, heretofore given him by me in cash, I estimate at three thousand one hundred dollars; I now give to my son Ludwick Summers two thousand dollars more. I own one thousand and ten acres of land in the western district of Tennessee, which I purchased of A. D. Murphy, all of which land I give unto my son Ludwick Summers, in consequence of services rendered by him in attending to, and the management of my estate heretofore, and other businesses. And whereas the said land is involved in a suit of laws, and the title litigated, now, if the said land shall be finally lost, it is my Will, and I hereby direct that all the cost which shall accrue and attend the same, shall be paid out of my estate.  <br><br>3rd: To my son Peter Summers, I give the tract of land whereon I now live, with all the buildings and appurtenances thereunto belonging, it being the tract I got of my father, together with all my other lands adjoining the same, and which lay in the County of Guilford, being a tract I purchased of Valentime Summers. I also give him the tract I purchased of George Christman, a part of which lies in Orange, and part in Guilford. I likewise give him the tract of land I purchased of Crowder, with the exception on one hundred acres thereof, which I reserve for my son Joshua. The line dividing it commencing a stone, and running thence North 25 chains to where it crosses the north bounding line, running thereunto a _____[not readable]___ in the tract which I purchased of Anthony Coble____[not readable]___ all of which said Coble land lying west of the above mentioned line , I also give him, it being about seventy acres. These lands, together with three hundred dollars which I have heretofore given him, I estimate at three thousand six hundred and eighty dollars.

That when they shall become of age, at the age of twenty-one, it is my Will and desire that said tract of land shall be sold, or equally divided betwixt the children of the said Abel Summers, as the said Jacob and Ludwick Summers Trustees may be advised, or think to be the most advantage to the said children. Nevertheless, if, and upon condition, the said Abel Summers would entirely forsake and abandon all the habits of intemperance and dissipation, and should practice and live a regular, temperate, and economical life, that then, the trustees shall permit and suffer the said Abel Summers to use and enjoy the said land, and from the use thereof to provide a support and living for himself and family. Though, the said trustees, Jacob and Ludwick Summers shall, and may, at any time resume the management and control of the said land, and deprive the said Abel Summers of the use and management thereof, whenever the trustees shall be of the opinion that the circumstances and condition of the said Abel Summers shall require it. And out of the proceeds, the said trustees shall receive reasonable compensation as trustees. And, in case either the said trustees should not act, then it is my Will and desire that the one acting, shall receive all the compensation. I estimate the above land and Still at fifteen hundred dollars.  <br><br>5th: I give unto my son Joshua Summers all the tract of land, that I bought of Anthony Coble, with the exception of about seventy acres, which I have given to my son Peter Summers, it being two hundred thirty eight acres, also one hundred acres of the Crowder tract, which I have mentioned and reserved. Which together with seven hundred dollars, heretofore given him in money, Stock, etc, make in all, two thousand three hundred and ninety dollars. I give to my son Joshua Summers, one negro boy, by the name of Ned, which I value at two hundred dollars, making the above amount, two thousand five hundred and ninety dollars.  I now give to my son Joshua Summers, eighteen hundred dollars more.  <br><br>6th: As to my daughter Barbara, I have advanced her in life with eleven hundred and fifty dollars in money, and also in Stock, and other things necessary for keeping house, and likewise two negroes, amounting in all to twenty-two hundred and fifty dollars, making her equal to the rest of my children. I now give her, in addition to what she has already received, all the money, or Legacy, given to me by Anthony Coble, of Rock Castle County, Kentucky in his last Will and Testament, And I do hereby authorize and empower my said Executors of Mr. Coble, to give receipts for, and hold the same to her own use. I give to my daughter Barbara, one thousand dollars, to be paid to her in such sums as my Executors may think her necessities shall require.  <br><br>7th: As to my daughter Rosa, wife of Jacob Clapp, I give to my son Ludwick Summers, his heirs and assigns, one negro girl, named Nancy, and the tract of land conveyed to me by the said Jacob Clapp, and which is adjoining the mill tract on the Reedy Fork, excepting what I have sold thereof to my son Ludwick Summers, and containing about one hundred acres, to have and to hold the said land, and negro girl, Nancy, to train. The said Ludwick Summers, his heirs and assigns in trust ___[not readable]___.

And after the death of my daughter Rosa, and all of her children shall have arrived at the age of twenty-one years, I then give the said land and negro girl to her children to have and to hold the same, to them and their own proper use. The land and negro, aforesaid, I estimate to be worth thirteen hundred dollars, which together with other monies, Stock, etc, that I have heretofore given to her and her husband Jacob Clapp, makes the sum to twenty-three hundred dollars, my son-in-law, Jacob Clapp, having become largely indebted to me for monies borrowed, and which I loaned him at various times. And to secure the payment thereof, he, on the 26th of May, 1821, conveyed to Ludwick Summers, in trust, the tract of land whereon he now lives, containing three hundred acres, lying on the waters of Irish Creek, in the County of Guilford. Now, if the said Jacob Clapp, shall at any time during his life, pay the debts and monies due me, with the interest, and shall fully discharge the trust, and all the purposes therein mentioned, I then direct the trustee, Ludwick Summers, and it is my Will and desire, that the recovery to the said Clapp, all the said land, and all of the said money arising therefrom, (i.e.), from the payment of debts, as aforesaid and the discharge of the trust. And I do hereby give unto the said Ludwick Summers, his heirs and assigns, in trust, for the sole use and benefit of my daughter Rosa, to be paid to her in such quantities and manner, and at such times as he, the said Ludwick, shall think that the situation and necessities of herself and family may require, and that all, or so much then of it as shall be remaining, and unexpended of the use and management thereof, whenever he shall think fit___[unreadable]___ and be of the opinion, that the circumstances and condition of my said daughter Rosa and her family shall require it.

And if either, or any of her children should die, be unmarried, and without having arrived to the years of twenty-one, then their respective share, or shares, to remain in the hands of my Executors, for the use and benefit of my daughter Rosa, to be given and applied to her use as they may think proper and fit and her necessities may require. It is my Will and desire, that my son Ludwick Summers shall be compensated out of the money and land left him as trustee for his trouble, or services, in that part of my estate.  <br><br>8th: As to my daughter Peggy, wife of Boston Gerringer, I have heretofore advanced her in life, with money, negroes, Stock, etc, for living, amounting to three thousand dollars, I now give to my daughter Peggy, wife of Boston Gerringer, to their children, fifteen hundred dollars, to be divided equally betwixt them.  <br><br>9th: To my daughter Lucy, wife of David Clapp, I have heretofore advanced her in life with money, negroes, Stock, and other things necessary for living, which together with the Legacy she has received from her Grandfather Whitsett, I estimate at two thousand four hundred dollars, I now give unto her during her natural life the use of fifteen hundred dollars, and at her death, to her children.
