<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font size="3"><b>OBITUARY:</b><br><br>ELON - <b>Annie Mae Somers Whitesell</b>, age 93, formerly of 4825 Whitesell Brothers Road, crossed over peacefully to her eternal home with her family by her side at White Oak Manor on April 21, 2010.<br>A native of Alamance County, she was the daughter of the late Berry Richard and Georgia Etta Somers Somers and the wife of the late Brice Rankin Whitesell, whom she married on December 14, 1935.<br>Annie Mae, along with her husband, visited the sick and shut-ins every Sunday. She would stop what she was doing, no matter what the chore, and give you her undivided attention.<br><br>She was a member of Bethlehem Christian Church in Altamahaw where she faithfully attended for over 70 years. She was a member of the Ever Ready Sunday School Class and faithfully attended the Summers-Somers Reunion held annually. She retired from Glen Raven Mills after 35 years. After her retirement from Lorillard in 1979, she spent the next 15 years doing the family genealogy. She, along with other ladies, would spend her days researching the countryside, adding missing family members to the family tree. She always had a smiling face for those folks whom she called upon as she went about her work. She loved looking at pictures of the "old days" as well as pictures of her family and especially her grandchildren. Dedication to her husband and the family farm, the gardens overflowing, and the love of her flowers, are among some of the things that kept her going all these years. She always told her family that she wanted lots of flowers while she was living.<br><br>You would always hear from her "Ya'll come on in!" and "Ya'll go back and make out your meal!" which were some of her favorite sayings. Those homemade biscuits that she always had at mealtime with a slab of homemade butter delighted everyone that sat at her table.<br><br>Those left behind are her daughter, Joyce Simmons and husband Jim of Elon; sons, Donald Whitesell and wife Linda, Cecil Whitesell and wife Sandra, both of Elon, and Terry Whitesell and wife Glenda of Burlington; grandchildren, Kathie Whitesell, Brian Whitesell and wife Leslie, Danny Simmons and wife Michele, David Simmons and wife Lisa, Ricky Whitesell and wife Lisa, Rodney Whitesell and wife Carmen, Tracy York and husband Jeff, Adam and Addison Whitesell. She was blessed with great-grandchildren, Baleigh and Colby Whitesell, Hunter, Meredith, Nolan and Landon Simmons, Kendall and Griffin Simmons, Jacob and Megan Whitesell, Ryan and Cassie Whitesell, Kaitlyn and Kelsey Mae York and great-stepgrandchild, Sabrina Welch and husband Jamie; sister-in-laws, Christine Bailey and husband James, Jewel Baldwin, and brother-in-law, Otis Whitesell.<br><br>She was preceded in death by her parents, husband, daughter, Rebecca Elizabeth Whitesell; and sister, Evelyn Dare Somers.<br><br>Our hearts are saddened over the loss. Those that knew Annie Mae will always remember her smile and laugh, and her dedication and faithfulness to her God and Savior. We shall always remember and cherish the significant impact of being our Mother and Grandmother.<br><br>A celebration of life will be held at 3 p.m. Saturday, April 24, 2010 at Bethlehem Christian Church by the Rev. Dave Gilbert and the Rev. Matt Smith. Interment will follow in Bethlehem Christian Church cemetery.<br><br>Mrs. Whitesell will remain at Lowe Funeral Home and Crematory until taken to the church to lie in state 30 minutes prior to the funeral service. The family will receive friends from 6 to 8 Friday evening at the funeral home and other times at the home of Joyce and Jim Simmons, 3813 Stoney Creek Church Road, Elon, N.C.<br><br>The family would like to thank the nurses and staff of White Oak Manor for their kind and compassionate care of their mother and grandmother.<br><br>Memorials may be made to Bethlehem Christian Church, P.O. Box 127, Altamahaw, N.C. 27202<br><br>You may sign the online register book at www.lowefuneralhome.com Page: Annie Mae Somers Whitesell</font></p>
