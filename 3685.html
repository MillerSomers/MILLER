<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font size="3"><b>OBITUARY:</b><br><br><b>Brice Rankin Whitesell</b>, age 91, of 4825 Whitesell Brothers Road, crossed over to his eternity at the Hospice Home on June 27, 2007.<br><br>Brice was a creditable and devoted individual who believed a man's word was as good as his handshake. Born October 18, 1915 in Guilford County, eighth of eleven children, to Eddie Hildrey Rankin and Callie Alventine Elizabeth Michael Whitesell, both deceased. He was a hard worker at any early age. He was an avid Atlanta Braves fan, enjoyed rabbit hunting, bluegrass music and along with his wife, visited the sick and shutins every Sunday.<br><br>Other than carrying out the tobacco farming operation in the Stoney Creek Community, he worked as a trademan at Hughes Tobacco Warehouse in Danville, VA for many years. Brice was a member of Bethlehem Christian Church in Altamahaw where he faithfully attended for over 71 ½ years. He was a member of the Men's Bible Class, served on the usher board, Deacon board and later became a Deacon Emeritus. In 2000 he was the recipient of the Senior Citizen Award. In his younger years, he was one of several people who cut timber and hauled it to the sawmill to provide building material for the presently standing church. When Altamahaw-Ossipee was a high school, Brice called balls and strikes for the Greentop Baseball Team. He received Alamance County's Conservation Farm Family Award for 2003 along with his son, Cecil, grandson Ricky, and great grandson Jacob. Brice was a charter member of the Western Alamance Farmers Club which was organized in 1950. He served on the nominating committee for the Summers-Somers Reunion held annually.<br><br>He was married on December 14, 1935 to Annie Mae Somers Whitesell, who survives. Children he left behind are Donald (Linda) Whitesell, Joyce (James "Jim" D.) Simmons, Cecil (Sandra) Whitesell all of Elon and Terry (Glenda) Whitesell of Burlington. His highlight was being around his grandchildren, Kathie , Brian (Leslie) Whitesell, Danny (Michele) and David (Lisa) Simmons, Ricky (Lisa) and Rodney (Carmen) Whitesell, Tracy (Jeff) York, Adam and Addison Whitesell. He was blessed with great grandchildren, Baleigh, Colby, Hunter, Meredith, Nolan, Landon, Kendall, Griffin, Jacob, Megan, Ryan, Cassie, Kaitlyn, and step great grandchild Sabrina.<br><br>He was also survived by his sisters, Christine (James Elbert) Bailey, Jewel Baldwin, brother, Otis Whitesell, sister-in-law Margaret Whitesell.<br><br>He was preceded in death by his parents, Eddie Hildrey Rankin Whitesell and Callie Alventine Elizabeth (Michael) Whitesell; his first child, Rebecca Elizabeth Whitesell; sister, Zora Smith (Weldon), Ethel Tate (John); brothers, Conrad Whitesell (Aubra), Willie Whitesell, Dwight Whitesell (Nova Holder), Howard Whitesell (Pennie), James Whitesell; sister-in-law, Helene Whitesell; brother-in-law, George Baldwin.<br><br>Our hearts are saddened over the loss. Those which knew Brice will always remember his unique laugh and repeating phrase "as the old saying is…." We shall always remember and cherish the significant impact of being our daddy, paw paw and friend. A celebration of life will be held at 3:00pm Saturday, June 30, 2007 at the Bethlehem Christian Church by Rev. Dave Gilbert, pastor. <i>(bio by: David Clay)</i></font></p>
