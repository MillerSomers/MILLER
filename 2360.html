<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font size="3"><b>LIFE STORY:</b><br><br>1909 INDIANA  --  <b>Jacob Witwer</b>, born in Lancaster County, Pa., worked on his father's farm, and moved to Summit County, Ohio, in 1844, when he was 16 years of age, and was then of great help to his parents, and being naturally inclined to work in wood and followed up and became a carpenter and cabinet maker,and became a great help to his father both at farming and at wood work. He was married Feb. 14 1850 to Susanna Weaver, and bought a home of a small farm, near the southeast corner of Summit County, Ohio, and divided his time between farming and carpenter work. At about 1864 or 1865 he sold his little farm to his brother, Abraham, and moved onto his father's (Abraham, Sr.) farm, taking care of them as the children had now all married, but the youngest, Anna. Grandfather had retired, so Jacob farmed for him and assisted at cabinet work in the carpenter shop, in the lane on the farm, and some years later, about 1878 or 1880, Jacob built himself a pleasant little house, out to the road and within a few rods of the southeast corner of Summit County, Ohio, and the same being the southwest corner of his farm in Stark County, Ohio, and where he is now residing. He and his noble wife are very highly respected, good and ardent members of the German Baptist Brethren, known more familiarly in that part of our beloved country as the Dunkard Church. They have raised a very nice and very highly respected family, which are all married, but one. They are living and enjoying a very comfortable and retired life, and Jacob, like his father, although at a more advanced age, being now in his 82nd year, is passing his time in making some nice pieces of furniture, etc., as a memento father ardent and respected grandfather, and as a token of his love for his good family.<br><i>(Courtesy of Witwer Family Tree, patt1945)</i><br><br><b>DEATH: </b>He is shown on the 1910 U.S. Census living with his wife Susanna and their son Levi.  So he could not have died in 1909 as is incorrectly stated on other family trees.  He is also listed on the Ohio, Death Index with a date of death of 22 May 1914.</font></p>
