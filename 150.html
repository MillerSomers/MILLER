<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font size="3">He started and owned the successful hamburger restaurant chain in Mexico called "TOMBOY"<br><br><i>(excerpts from article about Tomboy Restaurants on www.elfinanciero.com.mx):<br></i>The 1970s were the era of disco music and the first bites of hamburgers, but when the trendy dance subsided in the 1980s, the flavors of 'gringo' food resonated strongly throughout the country, first with establishments such as Burger Boy and Tomboy, which had a short-lived boom.<br><br>The nostalgic people who tasted that taste of 'hamburger mania' today remember precisely those sandwiches of yesteryear.<br><br>Everything exploded after the arrival of Burger Boy, considered the first hamburger chain in Mexico, after which many other establishments such as Tomboy opened and thus the Mexican torta began to find a new competitor that would become massive.<br><br>It's not that hamburgers were just arriving in Mexico in those days, in fact the first ones arrived in the country at the beginning of the 20th century, around the 30s, but they were sold in luxury restaurants as the American novelty sandwich or simply as a Hamburg-style meat dish.<br><br>Already in the 50s they began to proliferate in the streets as a quick snack in stalls and several establishments, but the trend came with Burger Boy, founded by two Puerto Rican businessmen and one Cuban.  Later, in 1974, the brand was bought by <u><b>Roberto González</u></b>, from Grupo Industrial Maseca.<br><br><b>Tomboy: The Novelty of In-Car Food</b><br>With the concept of fast food in the United States, Burger Boy opted to win over children's stomachs: in their golden age they began to sell 'unifantes', 'brontodobles', 'dinotriples' and 'locopopotes'.<br><br>In 1973 Tomboy was born. It was 1973 when their hamburgers, fries and milkshakes began to win over customers in trendy establishments such as the one located on Insurgentes Sur Avenue between Magnolias and Millet, in front of Parque Hundido, at that time they opened another branch in Acapulco, Guerrero.<br><br>Tomboy was known for its service to eat by car, in fact its parking lots were spacious, also at outdoor tables with umbrellas.<br><br>Inside, there were tables divided by rustic walls that provided privacy in meetings, as well as large planters.<br><br><b>What happened to Tomboy?</b><br>Like Burger Boy, Tomboy could not resist the arrival of the giant: McDonald's, which opened its first branch in the Mexico in 1985, in Pedregal, located south of Mexico City, during an opening with lines of several hours to live that American-style experience that caused so much curiosity and that exploded even more in the 90s.<br><br>Thus, Tomboy disappeared, although there is no clarity about the exact year.  However, on social media, nostalgics continue to remember it.<br><i>(see https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/food-and-drink/2022/07/09/que-paso-con-tomboy-la-competencia-de-burger-boy-en-los-70/)</i></font></p>
