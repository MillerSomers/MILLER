<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font size="3">From an out of copyright book: <i>"A twentieth century history of Berrien County, Michigan"</i> by Orville William Coolidge: <br><br>"<b>EMORY J. GLIDDEN</b> is a member of the firm of Glidden Brothers, general merchants at Lakeside, where he is also serving as postmaster. He has made a creditable business record, winning a gratifying measure of success and also an untarnished name through his straightforward methods. His birth occurred in Porter township, Van Buren county, April 16, 1863, and he there resided until he became a resident of Berrien county in 1873. His parents were Stephen M. and Harriett L. (Raub) Glidden, natives of New York. The father is still living, making his home with his son Emory, at the age of eighty years, but the mother passed away in 1904, when seventy years of age. In their family were six children: Asa C, who is a member of the firm of Glidden Brothers and has charge of the grocery and meat market owned by the firm at Michigan City; Martha Belle, who died at the age of twelve years; Orin S., who is engaged in business as a proprietor of a bakery at Michigan City; Hattie, the wife of M. L. Wiese, of Oklahoma; and Robert Franklin, who is also a member of the firm. The three brothers, Emory, Asa and Frank, carry on extensive business interests under the firm style of Glidden Brothers. <br><br>As before stated, Emory J. Glidden, remained a resident of his native county until, at the age of ten years, he accompanied his parents on their removal to Berrien county, locating at Harbert in this township. After a year he became a resident of Lakeside, where he has now lived for thirty-two years. In the winter months he attended school and thus acquired a fair English education, while in the summer seasons he was trained to farm labor. Four years ago he became connected with mercantile interests, joining his brothers, who had established the business two years before. The store was started six years ago by Orin S. Glidden, who a year later admitted his brother Frank to a partnership, while after two years Emory J. Glidden became one of the owners. They conduct not only a general store at Lakeside but also an extensive business in Michigan City. All four of the brothers were in business for two years, at the end of which time Orin S. Glidden retired and established a bakery business at Michigan City, where he has since continued. Mr. Glidden of this review is an active factor in the successful management of the general mercantile store at Lakeside, where they carry an extensive and well selected stock and are now enjoying a good patronage. They also own a good farm in the vicinity of Lakeside and derive therefrom a most gratifying income. <br><br>In 1890 occurred the marriage of Emory J. Glidden and Miss Carrie E. Gibson, who was born near Racine, Wisconsin, and came to Berrien county with her parents, Mr. and Mrs. John S. Gibson. This union has been blessed with one daughter, Ruth. The parents are members of the Methodist Episcopal church and in his political views Mr. Glidden is an earnest Republican, having supported the party since age conferred upon him the right of franchise. He was appointed postmaster three years ago to succeed his brother Orin upon his removal to Michigan City. The business methods of the house of which he is a partner are such as will bear the closest investigation and scrutiny, neither seeking nor requiring disguise, and the firm is now enjoying an extensive and well merited trade."</font></p>
