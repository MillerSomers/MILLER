<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font size="3"><b>IMMIGRATION:  </b>England to America in 1872<br><br><b>WILLIAM CALLARD FARM:  <br></b><i>"The William Callard Farm"</i> \endash  By. Mildred Holtforth Wyckoff, Granddaughter of William Callard (written in 1976) <br>   William and Elizabeth Callard were born near Plymouth, England and came as immigrants to America in 1872.  They left their only child, a daughter, Emma (Mrs. John Holtforth), with the child's grandparents, Robert and Elizabeth Anne Pote, before embarking.<br>   They first came to Hartland Township and worked on several farms.  The Ed Clark farm on Clyde Road and U. S. 23 was one place where they worked.  Being both energetic and thrifty, they were soon able to purchase a farm of their own: 160 acres of section 35, Tyrone Township, located on Fenton Road in 1877.  It was here that two daughters were born:  Elizabeth (Mrs. Willard Haller), and Lydia (Mrs. Herbert Lonsbury).<br>   In 1888, Elizabeth Callard returned to England to bring their daughter, Emma, then 18 years old, to America.  While enroute to Tyrone Township, Michigan, the great snow storm of 1888 descended (Mach 11).  The train was detained in Pennsylvania for two or three days.  William Callard met his wife and daughter at Clyde to escort their daughter to her new home, not in a fancy carriage, but with a team and a lumber wagon.  <br>   The home, of course, had no electricity.  For many years the family carried water from a spring which was 10 or 15 rods away from the house.  The grandchildren say it was the biggest treat in the world to go to the spring.  The water was dipped from a barrel into a trough for watering the livestock.  For housing the livestock, there were several sheds with straw roofs, and a small barn.  The first buildings erected by the Callards were a corn crib and a granary. The present large barn, which is still standing, was probably built about 1904.  There was a small orchard near the house; three or four quince trees, a couple of pear trees, peach and plum trees and some black currants which tasted bitter, but which made good jam.  Every farm seemed to have an apple orchard.<br>   The Callards adopted a son, George, a boy of about 12 from an orphanage in Coldwater, Michigan.  The children attended the Germany School.  <br>   A century has passed since William and Elizabeth came to the United States.  Many changes have taken place. Grandfather plowed with a single-bottom plow.  He had a sickle and cradle with which to harvest is grain and later on, a grain binder.  Perhaps he had a mower and rake to harvest the hay.  It was said that he was able to tire a team of horses between 4 a.m., when he would arise, and breakfast time.  A second team was available for the rest of the day.  This farm is still in the Holtforth family located on Denton Hill Road.  The house is being rented by Mr. and Mrs. Sam Sargent.  In 1977, it will qualify as a Centennial Farm.  In 1976 the great grandsons (fifth generation) operate powerful tractors pulling five or six bottom plows.  They have self-propelled combines which cut and thresh the grain and windrow the straw in one operation.  Hay-balers bale the hay and toss the bales into wagons in one operation.  One must say, "Grandfather walked and great-grandsons ride."  The only noticeable comparison is that the 5th generation members are enjoying wearing the forgotten beard of 1870 and are being thrifty by economizing letting their hair grow long.</font></p>
