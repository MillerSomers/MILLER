<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font size="3"><b>NOTES: </b>Sir John Wynne, Baronet of Gwgdir [Glyndwr]. He succeeded to his father's Estate in Wales in 1580; and in 1611 he was created a Baronet, in 1586 he was made a member of Parliament. And in 1606 he was made a Knight. He founded a hospital and a school.<br><br>This ancient family can trace their pedigree in a straight paternal line back to Rhodri the Great (in Welsh, Rhodri ap Mawr or Rhodri ap Merfyn; also known as "Roderick the Great") (c. 820 - 878), who was King of Gwynedd from 844 until his death.  Without listing every generation, the ancestry follows the paternal lines of: <br><br>(A) Maurice (or Morris) Wynne (or Morys Wynne ap John of Gwydir) (1520-1580)<br><br>(B) Robert ap Maredudd was the presumed Head of the House of Aberffraw following the death of Owain Lawgoch the last and only known surviving great-nephew of Llywelyn ap Gruffydd in 1378. He is cited by Sir John Wynn, 1st Baronet as his ancestor and head of the family at that time. He is known to have married a Welsh noble woman called Angharad ferch Dafydd ap Llywelyn. His full name showing his pedigree is Robert ap Maredudd ap Hywell ap Dafydd ap Gruffudd ap Caradog ap Thomas ap Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd.<br><br>(C) Tomas ap Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd was the only known son of Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd ruler of half Gwynedd from 1170-1195. In the 17th century, Sir John Wynn, 1st Baronet of Gwydir claimed and later proved his ancestor was Tomas ap Rhodri (via Robert ap Maredudd ap Hywell ap Dafydd ap Gruffudd ap Caradog ap Thomas ap Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd).<br><br>(D) Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd (1135?-1195) was prince of part of Gwynedd, one of the kingdoms of medieval Wales. He ruled from 1175 to 1195.<br><br>(E) Owain Gwynedd ap Gruffydd (Middle Welsh: Owain Gwyned; c. 1100 - 28 November 1170) was King of Gwynedd from 1137 until his death in 1170, and the first to be known as Prince of Wales.  He is considered to be the most successful of all the north Welsh princes prior to his grandson, Llywelyn the Great. He was known as Owain Gwynedd to distinguish him from another contemporary Owain ap Gruffydd, ruler of part of Powys who was known as Owain Cyfeiliog. Owain Gwynedd was a member of the House of Aberffraw, a descendant of the senior branch from Rhodri Mawr.<br><br>(F) Gruffudd ap Cynan (c. 1055 - 1137) was a King of Gwynedd. In the course of a long and eventful life, he became a key figure in Welsh resistance to Norman rule, and was remembered as King of all Wales. As a descendant of Rhodri Mawr, Gruffudd ap Cynan was a senior member of the princely house of Aberffraw.<br><br>(G) Idwal Foel ap Anarawd (English: "Idwal the Bald") (died 942) was a King of Gwynedd, referred to as [King of the Britons]] by William of Malmesbury in his Gesta Regum Anglorum. William spells his name as Judwalum in the original Latin (anglicized Jothwel); the Annales Cambriae spell it Iudgual. Idwal inherited the throne of Gwynedd on the death of his father Anarawd ap Rhodri in 916.<br><br>(H) Rhodri the Great (in Welsh, Rhodri ap Mawr or Rhodri ap Merfyn; occasionally in English "Roderick the Great") (c. 820 - 878) was <b>King of Gwynedd</b> from 844 until his death. He was the first Welsh ruler to be called 'Great', and the first to rule most of present-day Wales. He is referred to as "King of the Britons" by the Annals of Ulster. In some later histories, he is referred to as "King of Wales" but he did not rule all of Wales nor was this term used contemporaneously to describe him.<br><br><i>(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_of_Wales_family_trees)</i></font></p>
