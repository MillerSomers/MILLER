<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font size="3"><b>NOTES:</b><br><b>Red Shoes (Muskogean Chief) </b>was an Indian Chief of the prestigious Wind Clan (Hutalgalgi), the highest ranking tribe of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation.<br><br>He was the son of <b>Captain Jean Baptiste Louis DeCourtel Marchand</b>, French commander of Fort Toulouse in Alabama; and <b>Sehoy I</b>, Indian princess of the Wind Clan of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation.<br><br>His brother-in-law was <b>Lachlan McGillivray</b> (of the Clan MacGillivray Chiefs Lineage, part of the Clan Chattan Confederation of the Scottish Highland) who migrated to the Colonies and became a wealthy fur trader and planter in Georgia.<br><br>His nephew was <b>Alexander McGillivray</b> who became Chief of the Upper Creek (Muscogee) Indians, one of the most powerful and historically important Native American chiefs among the Creek of the Southeast.<br><br>His grandnephew was famed <b>Chief "Red Eagle"</b> of the Wind Clan (Hutalgalgi), the highest ranking tribe of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation.<br><br>His great grandnephew was <b>Major David Moniac, </b>an American military officer who in 1822 became the first Native American graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point.<br><br><b>BIOGRAPHY:</b><br>Red Shoes (born about 1720) was a Muskogean leader in the 18th Century. He primarily lived in modern Alabama but his influence extended well into modern Mississippi.<br><br>Red Shoes was the son of Jean Baptiste Louis DeCourtel Marchand and his Muskogee wife Sehoy. Since lineage among the Muskogee was traced matrilineally, Red Shoes, like his mother, was part of the Wind Clan. However, some sources say that Red Shoes was the son of Sehoy's second husband Red Shoes (Choctaw chief).<br><br>His sister, also named Sehoy, was the mother of Alexander McGillivray. In proper Muskogean tradition, Red Shoes raised Alexander in as if he were his own son. However, since Red Shoes's own children were members of their mother's clan, Alexander was Red Shoes's heir.<br><br>Red Shoes died about 1784.<br><br>Red Shoes raised his sister Sehoy's son, <b>Alexander McGillivray</b> (who became a principal Chief of the Creek/Muskogee), in proper Muskogean tradition as if Alexander was his own son, making Alexander an heir to Red Shoes.</font></p>
