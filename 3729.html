He supplied our needs and directed us to serve the Lord. He expressed his love for family and friends, not so much with words, but with his actions and deeds. It was common practice for him to stop whatever he was doing to assist someone who needed help.<br><br>In all of his interests and passions,heneverallowedthelack of a formal education to hinder him from doing his best. He had a thirst for knowledge and became self taught through studying books, magazines, and correspondence courses. He knew that happiness was not dependent upon earthly possessions and he found contentment with the blessings afforded him.<br><br>A native of Guilford County, he was the husband of the late Christine Whitesell Bailey for 64 years, and the son of the late Walter Bailey and the late Florence Lowman Bailey of McLeansville. James was a retired employee of Carolina Biological Supply Company with thirty years of service, and a member of Grace Bible Fellowship.<br><br>He is survived by his two sons, Ray E. Bailey and wife GlendaofElonandRickyL.Bailey and wife Janet of Burlington; four grandchildren, Ray E. Bailey, Jr. and his wife Laura of Gibsonville, J. Rodney Bailey and his wife Mala of Burlington, Kathryn B. Crawford and her husband Ryan of Burlington, and Beverly L. Bailey of Raleigh; three greatgrandchildren, Hunt, Caroline and Aanya Bailey.<br><br>He was preceded in death by two sisters, Dehlia B. Willoughby of Burlington and Lillie Mae Bailey of McLeansville.<br><br>The funeral service will be conducted at the Rich and Thompson Chapel in Burlington on Wednesday, December 22, 2010 at 2 p.m. by Pastor Ken Harman. Burial will follow in Alamance Memorial Park. The family will receive friends at the Rich &amp; Thompson Mortuary in Burlington on Wednesday from 12:30 until 2 p.m. prior to the funeral service.<br><br>Words cannot fully express our sincere thanks and gratitude for the loving care extended to James and his family during his journey. We offer our heartfelt thanks to all family and friends.
